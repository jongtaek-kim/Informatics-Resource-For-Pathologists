# Educational Informatics Resource For Pathologists and Other Healthcare Professionals.

## 1. Pathology Informatics Essentials for Residents, also known as [(PIER.)](https://www.apcprods.org/m-pier)  Available during pathology residency.
## 2. Clinical Informatics Fellowship Programs.  [Clinical Informatics](https://www.amia.org/news-and-publications/press-release/ci-is-subspecialty) became a medical subspecialty on Sept. 22, 2011.

## 4. Beginner's Learning Resources for Programming, Data Science, Bioinformatics, and Machine Learning. 
The web is full of resources but it can be a daunting place to start for someone with little or no computer science background such as medical students, residents, pathologists, and other physicians. This is meant to be a gentle and informative guide to get started.

## 1. Pathology Informatics Essentials for Residents [(PIER)](https://www.apcprods.org/m-pier)

Usually taken during the pathology residency/fellowship. PIER is a research-based instructional resource developed by the Association of Pathology Chairs, Association for Pathology Informatics, and College of American Pathologists that presents training topics, implementation strategies and resource options for PRODS and faculty to effectively provide informatics training to their residents and meet ACGME informatics milestone requirements. PIER is also an effective resource for aspiring specialists to develop [prerequisite pathology informatics knowledge and skills](https://www.pathologyinformatics.org/pier_and_api.php) prior to advanced training or fellowships.

## 2. Clinical Informatics Fellowship Programs Are Available to Pathologists and Other Physicians in All 24 Specialties.

There are over [30 ACGME-accredited Clinical Informatics Fellowship Programs](https://dev.amia.org/membership/academic-forum/clinical-informatics-fellowships) (7 based in departments of [pathology currently).](https://apps.acgme.org/ads/Public/Programs/Search?stateId=&specialtyId=383&specialtyCategoryTypeId=&numCode=&city=)
### Rationale for the Clinical Informatics Subspecialty [(source)](https://www.amia.org/clinical-informatics-board-review-course/history)
Successful health information system implementation depends in large measure on the knowledge and skills of the individuals who design, integrate, and implement these systems. While clinical informatics is multi-disciplinary in nature, there is a particular need for physicians who understand the care process, informatics concepts, and information technology. Creation of the formal subspecialty will help to standardize key elements of clinical informatics training programs and will likely increase the number of training opportunities. Further, it will provide an immediately recognized credential for organizations seeking to hire clinical informaticians. Finally, this initiative is consistent with the current national emphasis on strengthening the health information technology workforce.

Clinical Informatics fits within the spectrum of biomedical informatics as depicted by the American Medical Informatics Association (https://www.amia.org/)

## 3. [Pathology Informatics Fellowships](https://www.pathologyinformatics.org/pathology_informatics_training.php) are also available which long predate the Clinical Informatics Fellowships (since mid 1990's).  
These may or may not be accredited by the ACGME as clinical informatics fellowships, but through 2022, completing two years of training in a non-accredited PI program will qualify fellows to sit for the CI boards.

## 4. Beginner's Learning Resources for Programming, Data Science, Bioinformatics, and Machine Learning for Pathologists and Other Healthcare Professionals without Computer Science Background.  
There are enormous amount of resources online to choose from. One can read anything and everything online and take classes but not everyone, especially healthcare professionals, will have the necessary time to do so. Therefore, to learn effectively, a concise outline and map to navigate through these materials would be of importance.  
## Why do healthcare professionals need to get involved in deep learning and artificial intelligence (i.e. informatics)?
In his 2018 [JAMA article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2701666), Geoffrey Hinton gives health care professionals an intuitive understanding of the technology underlying deep learning with potential to transform health care.  In accompanying [JAMA article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2701667), David Naylor, a physician, outlines some of the factors propelling adoption of deep learning and artificial intelligence technology in medicine and health care. 

From the perspective of the field of pathology and laboratory medicine, computational pathology is the natural discipline that are being advocated due to advances in high-throughput laboratory and health information technologies. Louis DN et al. states in their [article ](http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/10.5858/arpa.2014-0034-ED?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed) "Pathologists, who are at the nexus of diagnostic data, models of disease pathogenesis, and clinical correlation, are ideally positioned to provide leadership in the emerging “big data” era of medical care."  Joseph Sirintrapun, MD, opines in his 2018 [ASCP article](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article-abstract/149/5/369/4925838?redirectedFrom=fulltext) that "Computational pathology extends on pathology informatics in leveraging innovative tools of deep learning and software development, the ramification of which requires informatics leadership to build and guide computational teams experienced in leveraging such modern tools". Before computational pathology (or even training in computational pathology) can succeed, pathologists and especially residents must decide to engage in, and build careers around, informatics and/or computation. The full article titled "Computational Pathology: A Path Ahead" can be found [here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26098131)

## Learning path resources will be divided into the following sections:
For starters, attending "data carpentry" workshops available near your university is a great way to start! Workshops are usually a 1-2 day hands-on instructor-taught tutorial. Their initial target audience is **learners who have little to no prior computational experience**. These are great for learning basic essentials before starting the learnng path. There are two main ones now known as ["The Carpentries"](https://carpentries.org/). These classes are archived and freely accessible online [here.](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/)

[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research.

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/) teach three core topics: the Unix shell, version control with Git, and a programming language (Python or R)
